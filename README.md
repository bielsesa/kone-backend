# BIMBAM! application's Backend
Backend for the "BIMBAM!" application developed for the KONE challenge at Junction 2024 Back Offline.

This backend acts as an intermediary between the Frontend and the PythonAPI, 
apart from acting as a classic Backend with communication with the data layer,
which is a MongoDB database.

Here you can find the links to the repositories of the other parts:
